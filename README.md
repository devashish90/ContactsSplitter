# ContactsSplitter
A simple Java console app that reads a vCard file containing multiple entries and each entry containing multiple phone numbers.

I started this project for my secondary phone Philips E130, in which I needed my Andorid contacts, but everything out there left me only the first phonenumber in a vcard.

With this app, I created a new vCard for each number and copied over the FormattedName from the original and added a suffix. 

So,

`Formatted Name`

`Cell1`

`Cell2`

becomes

`Formatted Name`

`Cell1`

and 

`Formatted-suffix Name`

`Cell2`

## Setup
Will be moving to maven soon. Till then, please manually add the jars in your Eclipse project from the following location :-
