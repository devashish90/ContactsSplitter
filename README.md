# ContactsSplitter
A simple Java console app that reads a vCard file containing multiple entries and each entry containing multiple phone numbers.

I started this project for my secondary phone Philips E130, in which I needed my Andorid contacts, but everything out there left me only the first phonenumber in a vcard.

##Credits :
[@mangstadt](https://github.com/mangstadt) for his awesome work in [Ez-vcard](https://github.com/mangstadt/ez-vcard)
This library made it really easy for me to achieve the goal.

## Setup
Will be moving to maven soon. Till then, please manually add the jars in your Eclipse project from the following location :-

[Ez-vcard Downloads - Release 0.9.8 jar with dependencies](http://mangstadt.github.io/ez-vcard/downloads/0.9.8/ez-vcard-0.9.8-with-deps.zip)

Hoping that my little app would help someone in need.
